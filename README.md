# Colour Picker Tutorial

A simple demo app designed to help teach React concepts

Essentially a React port of the jQuery example at [codepen](https://codepen.io/codedsignal/pen/QNzrbY)
designed to give an easy-to-follow insight into...

- React + JSX
- Unidirectional data flow (Flux architecture through Redux)
- Immutable data
- Tooling: Webpack, Babel, etc.

Built on [React Seed](git@github.com:oliverturner/react-seed.git)
